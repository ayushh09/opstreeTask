# Azure Bicep Labs

Welcome to the Azure Bicep Labs! These labs are designed to help you learn and master key concepts of Azure Bicep, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources. Follow the instructions in each lab to gain hands-on experience with Bicep.

## Lab 1: Understanding Bicep Deployments
### Overview
Introduction to Bicep syntax and structure.

### Activities
- Create a simple Bicep file for deploying a basic Azure resource (e.g., Azure Virtual Network).
- Understand the deployment process using Bicep.
- Explore Bicep CLI commands for deployment.

## Lab 2: Parameterize and Variablize Bicep Files
### Overview
Learn how to make Bicep files dynamic and reusable.

### Activities
- Parameterize key values in a Bicep file (e.g., resource names).
- Create and use variables for improving code maintainability.
- Experiment with different parameterization scenarios.

## Lab 3: Using Existing Resources and Working with Child Resources
### Overview
Extend Bicep knowledge to leverage existing resources and manage child resources.

### Activities
- Incorporate references to existing Azure resources in a Bicep file.
- Understand and implement the creation of child resources, both within and outside a parent resource.

## Lab 4: Modules
### Overview
Explore modularization using Bicep modules for code organization and reusability.

### Activities
- Creation of Bicep module for a specific functionalities.
- Utilize modules within a main Bicep file for improved code organization.
- Understand input and output parameters in Bicep modules.
